# 🧠 ASL Hand Gesture Translator (Web App)

A real-time American Sign Language (ASL) hand gesture recognition web app that uses machine learning and computer vision to translate static gestures into text. This project supports webcam input and displays live predictions with visual feedback.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is designed for local execution due to its computational demands. Real-time ASL translation involves MediaPipe hand tracking, video processing, and model inference, which may not run reliably on standard free hosting platforms.

For best results, clone the repository and run it on a machine with a decent CPU (or ideally a GPU).
> `You can still check out the demo on the hosted website but it is unreliable.`

## 📸 Features

- 🖐️ Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe
- 🔤 Alphabet and digit prediction using a pre-trained model
- 🎯 Clean and responsive UI
- 💡 Lightweight and easy to deploy

## 🚀 Quick Start

To run locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmmanRaikar/ASLTranslator.git
cd ASLTranslator
```

### 2. Install dependencies
It's recommended to use a Python 3.11.4 virtual environment. 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the app
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

## 🤖 Technologies Used

- Python & Flask
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 📌 Notes

- The model currently supports **static ASL hand gestures** (A–Z and 0–9).
- Dynamic gestures (e.g., words like "Hello", "Thank you") are not yet supported.
